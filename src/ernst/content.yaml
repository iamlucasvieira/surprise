  - Rubber duck debugging works best with a judgmental duck.
  - Never optimize code you haven't even written yet.
  - "Test coverage is like flossing: everyone lies about it."
  - Be the semicolon you wish to see in the codebase.
  - Never go to production without a plan... or snacks.
  - Naming things is hard. Naming people is easier. Consider that.
  - Your keyboard is your sword. Type responsibly.
  - Technical debt is just a startup's savings account.
  - Every bug is a misunderstood feature.
  - Sometimes you just need to reboot‚Ä¶ yourself.
  - Your commit history tells your life story. Make it dramatic.

  - Code like no one is watching‚Ä¶ but write docs like everyone is.
  - You can't spell 'debugging' without 'bug'. Coincidence?
